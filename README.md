## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This autonomous vehicle project is a showcase of my capabilities in designing, developing, and deploying embedded systems. 


Despite being a solo endeavor, I've created organized, structured, well-documented, maintainable, and reusable code suitable for high-volume manufacturing applications.


The vehicle is built using K'nex for the structural framework and Arduino Uno as the brain to control its movements. IR sensors are utilized for basic obstacle detection, and I am actively working on expanding its capabilities.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first extracts the word from the comment and then fetches word definitions, part of speech, example and source from the Oxford Dictionary API.

If the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary, the Oxford API then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Urban Dictionary API.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:
```
!dict word
```
The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

**Source:** https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=what%20is%20love

+ High-Quality Code: Despite being a one-person effort, the code is organized, structured, well-documented, and highly maintainable, suitable for scaling and manufacturing applications.


## Future Enhancements
In the near future, I plan to enhance this project with the following features:

Sonar Mapping: Incorporate sonar sensors to enable advanced room mapping capabilities.

Obstacle Avoidance: Further improve obstacle avoidance capabilities with advanced sensors and algorithms.

Machine Learning: Explore machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making and autonomy.
